# Silex template for Grunt.js

First you need grunt
```shell
	npm install -g grunt
```

Then add this all of the contents of this repository to the folder
```shell
	~/.grunt/tasks/init
```
If these folders do not exist you need to create them.


Then make sure that composer and MYSQL are accessible in the terminal.

To make composer installation global check out [Install Composer globally](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally)

Then just run in a new and empty directory
```shell
	grunt init:silex
```
