# Silex template for Grunt.js

First you need grunt
```shell
	npm install -g grunt
```

Then make sure that composer and MYSQL are accessible in the terminal.

To make composer installation global check out [Install Composer globally](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally)

Then just run
```shell
	grunt init:silex
```
